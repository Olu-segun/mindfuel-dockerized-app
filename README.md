📦 MindFuel – Dockerized Quote Delivery Service

This repository contains two tasks demonstrating how to containerize a Python-based email quote delivery service and run it as a multi-container application using Docker and Docker Compose.

The project fetches inspirational quotes, stores logs, connects to a relational database, and delivers emails to active subscribers.
